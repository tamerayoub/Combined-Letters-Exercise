Hello! Welcome to the Combine Letters Exercise by Tamer Ayoub!

Instructions:

1. Make sure the file paths for Output and Archive folders match your environment (Lines 20 and 21 in LetterService.cs)
2. Make sure the file paths for the Input Files match your environment (Lines 10 and 11 in Program.cs)

Now all you have to do is run the application, and the input files will get copied to the archive folder, the scholarship and admission input files will be combined in the output folder and the report.txt file will be generated

Note:

To promote re-useability, I didnt want to delete the input files from the input folder, so instead of moving them to archive, I copied them instead.

To reuse, please just delete the archive files and the input files to re-run the application from the beginning

Hope you enjoy!
